# EOSC 325 Assigment
Creating a new assignment for EOSC325 using Jupyter notebook. This assignment is based on the supplemental file for the book "Hydrogeological Properties of Earth Materials and Principles of Groundwater Flow", by the Groundwater Project.

The notebook has 5 parameters:
- $h_1$, hydraulic head at $x=0$
- $h_2$, hydraulic head at $x=L$
- $W$, recharge
- $K$, hydraulic conductivity
- $L$, max $x$

The first plot plots $h(x)$. It shows the location of $d$, the groundwater divide. The plot has qualitative arrows indicating the direction and magnitude of flow.

The second plot plots $q^{\prime}_x(x)$ and $y=0$. $q^{\prime}_x$ is the flow per unit width, and the groundwater divide occurs where $q^{\prime}_x=0$.
